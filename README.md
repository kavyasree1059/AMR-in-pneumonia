# AMR-in-pneumonia
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pneumonia is a critical healthcare challenge where bacteria no longer respond to antibiotics. This project applies machine learning models like Random Forest, Extra Trees, and LightGBM to predict resistant pneumonia cases, supporting early diagnosis and better antibiotic selection.
