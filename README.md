# AMR-in-pneumonia


Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pneumonia is a growing global health challenge that reduces the effectiveness of commonly used antibiotics against pneumonia-causing bacterial pathogens. This project focuses on analyzing and predicting antimicrobial resistance patterns in bacterial pneumonia using machine learning techniques.

The study utilizes a structured dataset containing bacterial and resistance-related features to classify resistant and non-resistant strains. Multiple machine learning models such as Random Forest, Extra Trees, and LightGBM are employed to achieve accurate and reliable predictions. The objective is to support early identification of resistant infections, assist clinical decision-making, and contribute to improved antibiotic stewardship.

This repository provides the complete pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result analysis, aimed at enhancing research and practical understanding of AMR in pneumonia.
